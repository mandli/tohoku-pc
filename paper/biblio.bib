  abstract = {Mesoscale and large-scale atmospheric models use a bulk surface flux
	algorithm to compute the turbulent flux boundary conditions at the
	bottom of the atmosphere from modeled mean meteorological quantities
	such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity. This study, on the
	other hand, uses a state-of-the-art bulk air-sea flux algorithm in
	stand-alone mode to compute the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible
	and latent heat, and enthalpy for a wide range of typical (though
	randomly generated) meteorological conditions over the open ocean.
	The flux algorithm treats both interfacial transfer (controlled by
	molecular processes right at the air-sea interface) and transfer
	mediated by sea spray. Because these two transfer routes obey different
	scaling laws, neutral-stability, 10-m transfer coefficients for enthalpy
	C(KN10), latent heat C(EN10), and sensible heat C(HN10) are quite
	varied when calculated from the artificial flux data under the assumption
	of only interfacial transfer-the assumption in almost all analyses
	of measured air-sea fluxes. That variability increases with wind
	speed because of increasing spray-mediated transfer and also depends
	on surface temperature and atmospheric stratification. The analysis
	thereby reveals as fallacious several assumptions that are common
	in air-sea interaction research-especially in high winds. For instance,
	C(KN10), C(EN10), and C(HN10) are not constants; they are not even
	single-valued functions of wind speed, nor must they increase monotonically
	with wind speed if spray-mediated transfer is important. Moreover,
	the ratio C(KN10)/C(DN10), where C(DN10) is the neutral-stability,
	10-m drag coefficient, does not need to be greater than 0.75 at all
	wind speeds, as many have inferred from Emanuel's seminal paper in
	this journal. Data from the literature and from the Coupled Boundary
	Layers and Air-Sea Transfer (CBLAST) hurricane experiment tend to
	corroborate these results.},

  journal = {Journal of Physical Oceanography},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {40},
  pages = {608–-619},
  abstract = {Forecasts for the intensity and intensity changes of tropical cyclones
	have not improved as much as track forecasts. In high winds, two
	routes exist by which air and sea exchange heat and momentum: by
	spray-mediated processes and by interfacial transfer right at the
	air–sea interface, the only exchange route currently parameterized
	in most storm models. This manuscript quantifies two processes mediated
	by sea spray that could affect predictions of storm intensity when
	included in coupled ocean–atmosphere models. Because newly formed
	spray droplets cool rapidly to an equilibrium temperature that is
	lower than the air temperature, they cool the ocean when they reenter
	it, clearly transferring enthalpy from sea to air. These reentrant
	droplets proliferate in storm winds and are predicted to transfer
	enthalpy at a rate comparable to interfacial processes when the near-surface
	wind speed reaches 30 m s−1. Because reentrant spray droplets give
	up pure water to the atmosphere during their brief lifetime, they
	return to the sea saltier than the surface ocean water and thus also
	constitute an effective salt flux to the ocean (also related to a
	freshwater flux and a buoyancy flux). That is, reentrant spray droplets
	add enthalpy to the atmosphere to power storms and destabilize the
	ocean by increasing the salinity at the surface. Both processes can
	affect storm intensity. This manuscript demonstrates the magnitudes
	of the spray enthalpy and salt fluxes by combining a sophisticated
	microphysical model and data from the study of Humidity Exchange
	over the Sea (HEXOS) and the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Tracks Experiment
	(FASTEX). It goes on to develop a fast algorithm for predicting these
	two fluxes in large-scale models.},

  abstract = {The intensity of tropical cyclones is sensitive to the rates at which
	enthalpy and momentum are transferred between sea and air in the
	high-wind core of the storm. Present models of the wind dependence
	of these transfer rates suggest that the effective drag coefficient
	is more than twice the effective enthalpy transfer coefficient at
	wind speeds above 25 m s−1. Using this ratio in numerical models,
	however, makes it impossible to sustain storms of greater than marginal
	hurricane intensity. Some other physical process must, therefore,
	enhance enthalpy transfer at very high wind speeds. This paper suggests
	that re-entrant sea spray explains this enhanced transfer. When a
	spray droplet is ejected from the ocean, it remains airborne long
	enough to cool to a temperature below the local air temperature but
	not long enough to evaporate an appreciable fraction of its mass.
	The spray droplet thus gives up sensible heat and returns to the
	sea before it has time to extract back from the atmosphere the heat
	necessary to continue its evaporation. Microphysical modeling, combined
	with data from the Humidity Exchange over the Sea Experiment (HEXOS),
	makes it possible to derive an expression for the net enthalpy transfer
	of re-entrant spray. This spray enthalpy flux is roughly cubic in
	wind speed. When this relation is used in a numerical simulation
	of a hurricane, the spray more than compensates for the observed
	increase in the ratio of drag and enthalpy transfer coefficients
	with wind speed. The momentum flux associated with sea spray is an
	important energy sink that moderates the effects of this spray enthalpy
	flux. Including a parameterization for this momentum sink along with
	wave drag and spray enthalpy transfer in the hurricane simulation
	produces results that are similar to ones based on equal transfer
	coefficients.},

  title = {A Bulk Turbulent Air–Sea Flux Algorithm for High-Wind, Spray Conditions},
  journal = {Journal of Physical Oceanography},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {1581–-1596},
  abstract = {Sensible and latent heat can cross the air–sea interface by two routes:
	as interfacial fluxes controlled by molecular processes right at
	the interface, and as spray fluxes from the surface of sea spray
	droplets. Once the 10-m wind speed over the ocean reaches approximately
	11–13 m s−1, the spray sensible and latent heat fluxes become significant
	fractions (i.e., 10% or greater) of the corresponding interfacial
	fluxes. The analysis here establishes that result by combining the
	Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response
	Experiment (COARE) version 2.6 bulk interfacial flux algorithm with
	a microphysical spray model to partition measured heat fluxes from
	two good high-wind datasets into spray and interfacial flux contributions.
	The measurements come from the Humidity Exchange over the Sea (HEXOS)
	experiment and the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Tracks Experiment (FASTEX);
	wind speeds in these two datasets span 5 to 20 m s−1.
	
	
	After the measured heat fluxes are separated into spray and interfacial
	contributions, the spray fluxes are used to develop a fast spray
	flux algorithm to combine with the COARE version 2.6 interfacial
	flux algorithm in a unified turbulent surface flux algorithm for
	use in large-scale and ocean storm models. A sensitivity analysis
	of the spray and interfacial components of this unified flux algorithm
	demonstrates how the two component fluxes scale differently with
	the mean meteorological variables and why they must therefore be
	parameterized separately in models intended to treat air–sea fluxes
	in high winds.},

	standard deviation and a mean enthalpy coefficient C-K of 1.0 x 10(-3)
	with a 40\% standard deviation for wind speeds between 52 and 72
	m s-1. These are the first known estimates of C-K and the ratio of
	enthalpy to drag coefficient C-K/C-D in major hurricanes. The results
	suggest that there is no significant change in the magnitude of the
	bulk exchange coefficients estimated at minimal hurricane wind speeds,
	and that the ratio C-K/C-D does not significantly increase for wind
	speeds greater than 50 m s(-1).},

  abstract = {{[}1] A 1993-1996 hindcast of the North Atlantic circulation is presented
	and analyzed. Multivariate satellite observations (sea surface height
	and sea surface temperature) are assimilated into an isopycnic coordinate
	ocean model (Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model {[}MICOM]) using
	a reduced order Kalman filter (the SEEK filter). The objective is
	to validate the assimilation system in hindcast mode before running
	a near real-time exercise as part of the European DIADEM project.
	The analysis scheme is upgraded to make the statistical parameterization
	as realistic as possible, and this is shown to be particularly important
	as soon as a multivariate data set is used. Second, the paper describes
	the modifications to the SEEK filter that are necessary to meet the
	requirements of a layered model and to benefit from the advantages
	of the isopycnic coordinate. In particular, the need for an initialization
	procedure is explained, and this dynamical adjustment is shown to
	be more natural and robust in the context of the isopycnic coordinate.
	The hindcast experiment is validated by comparisons with observations,
	by studying innovation statistics, and by comparing the results with
	independent observations (expendable bathythermograph {[}XBT] profiles).},

  pages = {1125-1143},

  abstract = {Using numerical simulations, this study examines the sensitivity of
	hurricane intensity and structure to changes in the surface exchange
	coefficients and to changes in the length scales of a turbulence
	parameterization. Compared to other recent articles on the topic,
	this study uses higher vertical resolution, more values for the turbulence
	length scales, a different initial environment (including higher
	sea surface temperature), a broader specification of surface exchange
	coefficients, a more realistic microphysics scheme, and a set of
	three-dimensional simulations. The primary conclusions from a recent
	study by Bryan and Rotunno are all upheld: maximum intensity is strongly
	affected by the horizontal turbulence length scale l(h) but not by
	the vertical turbulence length scale l(v), and the ratio of surface
	exchange coefficients for enthalpy and momentum, C-k/C-d, has less
	effect on maximum wind speed than suggested by an often-cited theoretical
	model. The model output is further evaluated against various metrics
	of hurricane intensity and structure from recent observational studies,
	including maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, surface wind-pressure
	relationships, height of maximum wind, and surface inflow angle.
	The model settings l(h) approximate to 1000 m, l(v) approximate to
	50 m, and C-k/C-d approximate to 0.5 produce the most reasonable
	match to the observational studies. This article also reconciles
	a recent controversy about the likely value of C-k/C-d in high wind
	speeds by noting that simulations in a study by Emanuel used relatively
	large horizontal diffusion and low sea surface temperature. The model
	in this study can produce category 5 hurricanes with C-k/C-d as low
	as 0.25.},

  abstract = {The viability of a generalized ( Hybrid) Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM),
	together with the importance of thermobaricity and the choice of
	reference pressure, is demonstrated by analyzing simulations carried
	out using the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Community
	Modeling Experiment (CME) Atlantic basin configuration. The standard
	hybrid vertical coordinate configuration is designed to remain isopycnic
	throughout as much of the water column as possible while smoothly
	making a transition to level ( pressure) coordinates in regions with
	weak vertical density gradients, such as the surface mixed layer,
	and to terrain-following coordinates in shallow-water regions. Single-coordinate
	( pressure or density) experiments illustrate the flexibility of
	the model but also bring forward some of the limitations associated
	with such a choice. Hybrid experiments with potential density referenced
	to the surface (sigma(theta)) and to 20 MPa (similar to2000 m) (sigma(2))
	illustrate the increased influence of pressure errors with increasing
	distance from the reference pressure. The sigma(theta) hybrid experiment
	does not properly reproduce the northward flow of Antarctic Bottom
	Water (AABW), and large errors in near-surface pressure gradients
	in the sigma(2) experiment produce a wind-driven gyre circulation
	that is too strong, when compared with observations, and a North
	Atlantic Current that follows an unrealistic path. These near-surface
	and near-bottom pressure errors are removed when thermobaric effects
	are included, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
	upper-ocean gyre circulation, the northward AABW flow near the bottom,
	and the meridional overturning circulation and heat flux.},

  abstract = {The formation of cyclones in the vicinity of the Loop Current ring
	during the separation stage is analyzed in the frame of a high-resolution
	ECMWF daily wind-forced Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM)
	simulation. Mesoscale cyclones, observed in sea surface height maps
	in the vicinity of the Loop Current in a necking-down position, are
	found to contribute to the separation of the ring from the Loop Current
	as they grow between the Loop Current and the ring in the MICOM simulation.
	To understand the origin of the cyclones, the instability of the
	Loop Current idealized as an isolated vortex is studied. After noticing
	the cyclonic vorticity belt around the Loop Current, and based on
	the vertical distribution of potential vorticity in a Loop Current
	ring in the MICOM simulation, the linear stability of a shielded
	vortex is studied in the quasigeostrophic formalism. To simulate
	the effects of the planetary vorticity gradient and topography on
	the Loop Current, the nonlinear states of the idealized Loop Current
	are analyzed using the adiabatic MICOM code. Results from the analysis
	of the MICOM simulation show that cyclones are the products of a
	vortex rim instability. The modal analysis of the Loop Current instability
	reveals that mode 4 is the fastest-growing mode and that baroclinic
	(barotropic) instability is intensified in the deep (surface) layers.
	These results are confirmed by the analytical study of the idealized
	Loop Current. The nonlinear state shows that a Loop Current-like
	vortex is indeed a pentapole on an f plane. On the beta plane, the
	northern cyclone is separated from the anticyclone by the beta effect
	and both drift westward. When the topography of the Gulf of Mexico
	is taken into account-namely, the Campeche Bank, the southward slope
	north of the Loop Current, and the Florida shelf east of the Loop
	Current-several effects are observed: 1) the northern corner of the
	Campeche Bank erodes the Loop Current ring and its cyclones and interacts
	with the vortex's most unstable mode, 2) the northern southward slope
	scatters the northern cyclone while the anticyclone remains coherent
	and propagates to the west, and 3) realistic westward propagation
	speeds are obtained in the presence of the northern Campeche shelf,
	which acts as a mirror effect on the Loop Current ring, as opposed
	to the Florida shelf, which tends to block the ring.},

  abstract = {{[}1] The deep flow variability in the vicinity of the Yucatan Channel
	between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico is examined within
	a high-resolution numerical simulation of the North Atlantic Ocean.
	We focus on the 6 year integral cycle of Loop Current (LC) ring formation,
	and we study the flow regimes both in the Yucatan Channel and farther
	north in the LC. The circulation in the vicinity of the Yucatan Channel
	presents a high variability in the flow regimes and in the shedding
	period, in good agreement with earlier observations. The outflow
	( toward the Caribbean Sea) in the Yucatan Channel is shown to be
	controlled in part by a regular shift of the LC maximum velocity
	position, in phase with the transport variations. The outflow follows
	the inflow variations independently of the northward extension of
	the LC. Our analysis of the growth of the loop is also shown to be
	in good agreement with the ballooning process proposed by Pichevin
	and Nof ( 1997) and Nof and Pichevin ( 2001) to explain the LC ring
	formation. Moreover, at the end of each cycle of ring formation a
	sudden deepening of the LC deepest layer occurs together with an
	intensification of the transport and of the currents in the deep
	layers beneath the LC. This process is shown to be connected with
	the growth of cyclones in the deep layers. They result from the bottom-intensified
	instability of the LC ring and contribute to its separation from
	the LC.},

	using a stochastic ODE and constructing a corresponding Kalman filter
	model.
	
	
	The proofs and derivations in the third
	
	edition of Kalman Filtering with Real-Time
	
	Applications lead to a deep understanding
	
	of the linear Kalman filter algorithm as an
	
	optimal estimator for the state sequence
	
	in a system with stochastic dynamics and
	
	measurements. It is a good book for researchers
	
	with a strong mathematical background
	
	who will be building Kalman filters
	
	and smoothers. It is also a good text for
	
	teaching a course on linear Kalman filtering
	
	and some of its extensions.
	
	The book provides many interesting applications
	
	of the Kalman filter and derives
	
	specialized versions of the algorithm that reduce
	
	the amount of computation for these
	
	applications. While these derivations are
	
	straightforward, they involve a lot of algebra
	
	and time for careful derivation. This
	
	suggests research in the area of a generalpurpose
	
	tool for automated generation of
	
	the computer source code corresponding to
	
	a specific linear Kalman filter.

  abstract = {High-resolution models and realistic boundary conditions are necessary
	to reproduce the mesoscale dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).
	In order to achieve this, we use a nested configuration of the Hybrid
	Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), where the Atlantic TOPAZ system provides
	lateral boundary conditions to a high-resolution (5 km) model of
	the GOM . However, such models cannot provide accurate forecasts
	of mesoscale variability, such as eddy shedding event, without data
	assimilation. Eddy shedding events involve the rapid growth of nonlinear
	instabilities that are difficult to forecast. The known sources of
	error are the initial state, the atmospheric condition, and the lateral
	boundary condition. We present here the benefit of using a small
	ensemble forecast (10 members) for providing confidence indices for
	the prediction, while using a data assimilation scheme based on optimal
	interpolation. Our set of initial states is provided by using different
	values of a data assimilation parameter, while the atmospheric and
	lateral boundary conditions are perturbed randomly. Changes in the
	data assimilation parameter appear to control the main position of
	the large features of the GOM in the initial state, whereas changes
	in the boundary conditions (lateral and atmospheric) appears to control
	the propagation of cyclonic eddies at their boundary. The ensemble
	forecast is tested for the shedding of Eddy Yankee (2006). The Loop
	Current and eddy fronts observed from ocean color and altimetry are
	almost always within the estimated positions from the ensemble forecast.
	The ensemble spread is correlated both in space and time to the forecast
	error, which implies that confidence indices can be provided in addition
	to the forecast. Finally, the ensemble forecast permits the optimization
	of a data assimilation parameter for best performance at a given
	forecast horizon.},

	cheap Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) in conjunction with the
	Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) model for assimilating altimetry
	data. The covariance matrix extracted from a historical ensemble,
	is three-dimensional and multivariate. This study shows that the
	multivariate correlations with sea level anomaly are coherent with
	the known dynamics of the area at two locations: the central part
	of the GOM and the upper slope of the northern shelf. The correlations
	in the first location are suitable for an eddy forecasting system,
	but the correlations in the second location show some limitations
	due to seasonal variability. The multivariate relationships between
	variables are reasonably linear, as assumed by the EnOI. Our DA set-up
	produces little noise that is dampened within 2 d, when the model
	is pulled strongly towards observations. Part of it is caused by
	density perturbations in the isopycnal layers, or artificial caballing.
	The DA system is demonstrated for a realistic case of Loop Current
	eddy shedding, namely Eddy Yankee.},

  abstract = {Hurricane intensity is sensitive to fluxes of enthalpy and momentum
	between the ocean and atmosphere in the high wind core of the storm.
	It has come to be recognized that much of this exchange is likely
	mediated by sea spray. A number of representations of spray-mediated
	exchange have appeared in recent years, but when these are applied
	in numerical simulations of hurricanes, storm intensity proves sensitive
	to the details of these representations. Here it is proposed that
	in the limit of very high wind speed, the air-sea transition layer
	becomes self-similar, permitting deductions about air-sea exchange
	based on scaling laws. In particular, it is hypothesized that exchange
	coefficients based on the gradient wind speed should become independent
	of wind speed in the high wind limit. A mechanistic argument suggests
	that the enthalpy exchange coefficient should depend on temperature.
	These propositions are tested in a hurricane intensity prediction
	model and can, in principle, be tested in the field.},

  journal = {Journal of Atmospheric Sciences},

  pages = {3969–-3976},
  abstract = {Numerical and theoretical models of tropical cyclones indicate that
	the maximum wind speed in mature storms is sensitive to the ratio
	of the enthalpy and momentum surface exchange coefficients and that
	the spinup time of tropical cyclones varies inversely with the magnitude
	of these coefficients. At the same time, the Carnot cycle model developed
	by the author predicts that the central pressure of mature cyclones
	is independent of the magnitude of the exchange coefficients. The
	author presents numerical simulations that prove this last prediction
	false and suggest that the reason for this failure is the neglect
	of eye dynamics in the steady-state theory. On this basis, the existing
	theory is modified to account for eye dynamics, and the predictions
	of the revised theory are compared to the results of numerical simulations.
	
	
	Both the revised theory and the numerical modeling results, when compared
	to observations, suggest that the ratio of enthalpy to momentum exchange
	coefficients in real hurricanes lies in the range 0.75–1.5, contradicting
	published speculations about the behavior of this ratio at high surface
	wind speed.},

  abstract = {We consider the numerical integration of multivariate functions defined
	over the unit hypercube. Here, we especially address the high-dimensional
	case, where in general the curse of dimension is encountered. Due
	to the concentration of measure phenomenon, such functions can often
	be well approximated by sums of lower-dimensional terms. The problem,
	however, is to find a good expansion given little knowledge of the
	integrand itself. The dimension-adaptive quadrature method which
	is developed and presented in this paper aims to find such an expansion
	automatically. It is based on the sparse grid method which has been
	shown to give good results for low- and moderate-dimensional problems.
	The dimension-adaptive quadrature method tries to find important
	dimensions and adaptively refines in this respect guided by suitable
	error estimators. This leads to an approach which is based on generalized
	sparse grid index sets. We propose efficient data structures for
	the storage and traversal of the index sets and discuss an efficient
	implementation of the algorithm. The performance of the method is
	illustrated by several numerical examples from computational physics
	and finance where dimension reduction is obtained from the Brownian
	bridge discretization of the underlying stochastic process.},

  abstract = {Vertical coordinate and vertical mixing algorithms included in the
	HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) are evaluated in low-resolution
	climatological simulations of the Atlantic Ocean. The hybrid vertical
	coordinates are isopycnic in the deep ocean interior, but smoothly
	transition to level (pressure) coordinates near the ocean surface,
	to sigma coordinates in shallow water regions, and back again to
	level coordinates in very shallow water. By comparing simulations
	to climatology, the best model performance is realized using hybrid
	coordinates in conjunction with one of the three available differential
	vertical mixing models: the nonlocal K-Profile Parameterization,
	the NASA GISS level 2 turbulence closure, and the Mellor-Yamada level
	2.5 turbulence closure. Good performance is also achieved using the
	quasi-slab Price-Weller-Pinkel dynamical instability model. Differences
	among these simulations are too small relative to other errors and
	biases to identify the ``best{''} vertical mixing model for low-resolution
	climate simulations. Model performance deteriorates slightly when
	the Kraus-Turner slab mixed layer model is used with hybrid coordinates.
	This deterioration is smallest when solar radiation penetrates beneath
	the mixed layer and when shear instability mixing is included. A
	simulation performed using isopycnic coordinates to emulate the Miami
	Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM), which uses Kraus-Turner
	mixing without penetrating shortwave radiation and shear instability
	mixing, demonstrates that the advantages of switching from isopycnic
	to hybrid coordinates and including more sophisticated turbulence
	closures outweigh the negative numerical effects of maintaining hybrid
	vertical coordinates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To simulate tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, coupled ocean -atmosphere
	prediction models must realistically reproduce the magnitude and
	pattern of storm-forced sea surface temperature (SST) cooling. The
	potential for the ocean to support intensification depends on the
	thermal energy available to the storm, which in turn depends on both
	the temperature and thickness of the upper-ocean warm layer. The
	ocean heat content (OHC) is used as an index of this potential. Large
	differences in available thermal energy associated with energetic
	boundary currents and ocean eddies require their accurate initialization
	in ocean models. Two generations of the experimental U. S. Navy ocean
	nowcast -forecast system based on the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model
	(HYCOM) are evaluated for this purpose in the NW Caribbean Sea and
	Gulf of Mexico prior to Hurricanes Isidore and Lili (2002), Ivan
	(2004), and Katrina (2005). Evaluations are conducted by comparison
	to in situ measurements, the navy's three-dimensional Modular Ocean
	Data Assimilation System (MODAS) temperature and salinity analyses,
	microwave satellite SST, and fields of OHC and 26 degrees C isotherm
	depth derived from satellite altimetry. Both nowcast -forecast systems
	represent the position of important oceanographic features with reasonable
	accuracy. Initial fields provided by the first-generation product
	had a large upper-ocean cold bias because the nowcast was initialized
	from a biased older-model run. SST response in a free-running Isidore
	simulation is improved by using initial and boundary fields with
	reduced cold bias generated from a HYCOM nowcast that relaxed model
	fields to MODAS analyses. A new climatological initialization procedure
	used for the second-generation nowcast system tended to reduce the
	cold bias, but the nowcast still could not adequately reproduce anomalously
	warm conditions present before all storms within the first few months
	following nowcast initialization. The initial cold biases in both
	nowcast products tended to decrease with time. A realistic free-running
	HYCOM simulation of the ocean response to Ivan illustrates the critical
	importance of correctly initializing both warm-core rings and cold-core
	eddies to correctly simulate the magnitude and pattern of SST cooling.},

	where previous studies have suggested there is a distinct
	
	regime change at the air‐sea interface. This value is well
	
	below the expected threshold value for intense hurricanes of
	
	0.75. Recent three‐dimensional model studies also find that

  abstract = {The three-dimensional Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction
	System (COAMPS) has been developed by the Naval Research Laboratory.
	COAMPS consists of an atmospheric data assimilation system comprising
	data quality control, analysis, initialization, and nonhydrostatic
	forecast model components, as well as a hydrostatic ocean model.
	The models can be integrated simultaneously so that the surface fluxes
	of heat, momentum, and moisture are exchanged across the air-water
	interface every time step. Optionally, either the atmospheric or
	ocean model can be used as a stand-alone system. The atmospheric
	component of COAMPS was used for operational support for the America(3)
	team in the 1995 America's Cup races. Results of these forecasts
	indicated the necessity of data assimilation to reduce model spinup
	in the first 6 h of the forecast. Accurate forecasts of the low-level
	wind in the coastal race area was accomplished by utilizing triply
	nested grids to attain the necessary high resolution to resolve the
	local wind patterns and the underlying surface terrain field. Two
	idealized simulations of a tropical cyclone were performed with COAMPS.
	In the first simulation, only the atmospheric model was used, assuming
	a fixed sea surface temperature (SST). A realistic structure developed
	with spiral bands of convection present outside the inner eyewall.
	These spiral bands occasionally contracted inward resulting in rapid
	fluctuations in the intensity of the tropical cyclone. In the second
	simulation, the ocean model was run simultaneously with the atmospheric
	model. The SST cooled over 8 degrees C over a small area within the
	radius of maximum winds, resulting in a much weaker system. However,
	there appeared to be little effect on the overall strength of the
	system, as measured by the tangential velocities outside the radius
	of maximum winds.},

	representing properties of cloud ice are discussed. Several modifications
	are introduced to more realistically simulate some of the ice microphysical

	is a function of temperature, a new and separate assumption is developed
	in which ice crystal number concentration is a function of ice amount.
	Related changes in ice microphysics are introduced, and the impact
	of sedimentation of ice crystals is also investigated. In an idealized
	thunderstorm simulation, the distribution of simulated clouds and
	precipitation is sensitive to the assumptions in microphysical processes,
	whereas the impact of the sedimentation of cloud ice is small. Overall,
	the modifications introduced to microphysical processes play a role
	in significantly reducing cloud ice and increasing snow at colder
	temperatures and slightly increasing cloud ice and decreasing snow
	at warmer temperatures. A mesoscale simulation experiment for a heavy
	rainfall case indicates that impact due to the inclusion of sedimentation
	of cloud ice is not negligible but is still smaller than that due
	to the microphysics changes. Together with the sedimentation of ice,
	the new microphysics reveals a significant improvement in high-cloud
	amount, surface precipitation, and large-scale mean temperature through
	a better representation of the ice cloud-radiation feedback.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal
	turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL).
	Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior
	of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm
	that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models
	is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion
	of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the
	PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL
	(YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised
	scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong
	and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing
	in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it
	in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates
	the well-known problems in the Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive
	mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved.
	Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is
	also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the
	Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure
	of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado
	outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale
	features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL
	are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing
	the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately
	predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the
	case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL
	scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense
	convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme
	remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe
	convection when the front triggers it.},

	becoming even more important to reduce threats to lives and property
	in coastal regions. To improve predictions, accurate evaluation of
	the air-sea momentum exchange is required. Using current observations
	recorded during a major tropical cyclone, we have estimated this
	momentum transfer from the ocean side of the air-sea interface, and
	we discuss it in terms of the drag coefficient. For winds between
	20 and 48 meters per second, this coefficient initially increases
	and peaks at winds of about 32 meters per second before decreasing.},

  abstract = {A new one-dimensional cloud model, specifically designed for application
	in mesoscale convective parameterization schemes (CPSs), is introduced.
	The model is unique in its representation of environmental entrainment
	and updraft detrainment rates. In particular, the two-way exchange
	of mass between clouds and their environment is modulated at each
	vertical level by a buoyancy sorting mechanism at the interface of
	clear and cloudy air. The new entrainment/detrainment scheme allows
	vertical profiles of both updraft moisture detrainment and updraft
	vertical mass flux to vary in a physically realistic way as a function
	of the cloud-scale environment. These performance characteristics
	allow the parameterized vertical distribution of convective heating
	and drying to be much more responsive to environmental conditions
	than is possible with a traditional one-dimensional entraining plume
	model. The sensitivities of the new model to variations in environmental
	convective available potential energy and vertical moisture distribution
	in idealized convective environments are demonstrated and its sensitivities
	to several key control parameters are examined. Finally, the performance
	of the new model in the Fritsch-Chappell CPS is evaluated. Parameterized
	heating and drying profiles are elucidated as they relate to the
	convective environment and to the type of cloud model used in the
	CPS.},

  abstract = {This study is a multimetric statistical evaluation of interannual
	and climatological mean sea surface temperature (SST) over the Pacific
	Ocean (north of 20 degrees S) simulated by an ocean model. The evaluation
	procedure is outlined using daily and monthly SSTs from eddy-resolving
	(0.08 degrees) Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Satellite-based
	products and buoy measurements are used for model-data comparisons.
	Three are three principal findings. (1) Using monthly mean climatological
	atmospheric forcing with the addition of a 6-hourly wind component
	can yield realistic simulations of monthly mean climatological SST
	in comparison with observations and interannually forced simulations.
	(2) Nondimensional skill score can be a very useful metric for validating
	SST from an ocean model in a large region, such as the Pacific Ocean,
	where the amplitude of the SST seasonal cycle has large spatial variations.
	The use of skill score is extensively discussed along with its advantages
	over other traditional metrics. Interannual model-data comparisons
	(1993-2003) using satellite-based SST give basin-averaged yearly
	mean skill score values ranging from 0.35 to 0.58 for HYCOM. (3)
	A comparison of HYCOM to 804 yearlong daily buoy SST time series
	spanning 1990-2003 gives a median root mean square value of 0.83
	degrees C. Relatively small SST biases and high skill values are
	essential prerequisites for SST assimilation using an ocean model
	as a first guess and for SST forecasting. The validation procedures
	presented in this paper include a variety of statistical metrics
	and use a comprehensive observational buoy data set. Such procedures
	can be applied to any global- or basin-scale ocean general circulation
	model that predicts SST.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the ability of three ocean mixed layer submodels
	to depict inter- annual variations of sea surface temperature ( SST)
	in a global configuration of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (
	HYCOM). The mixed layer submodels are ( 1) the K- Profile Parameterization
	( KPP), ( 2) the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS)
	turbulence closure, and ( 3) the Mellor- Yamada Level 2.5 ( MY) turbulence
	closure. Accuracy of SSTs from the submodels is investigated during
	1996 - 2001, which includes the onset of the strong 1998 La Nina
	event, when a record cold SST anomaly in the eastern equatorial Pacific
	occurred. The model simulations ( with no ocean data assimilation
	or relaxation to SST climatology) reveal that all three submodels
	generally capture the westward extent of the SST cooling within the
	eastern equatorial Pacific during the transition period from the
	1997 El Nino to the 1998 La Nina, one of the largest short term events
	ever observed ( 7 degrees C change in SST from May to June 1998).
	During the six- month period after the transition, the daily SST
	from the submodels is approximate to 2 degrees C warmer than the
	buoy SSTs obtained from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean ( TAO) array.
	Some of these biases are due to deficiencies in the net shortwave
	radiation and near- surface air temperature used for the simulations.
	Finally, comparisons with 166 yearlong daily SST time series from
	many buoys over various regions of the global ocean, including mostly
	equatorial Pacific, give median RMS differences of 0.65 degrees,
	0.70 degrees, and 0.78 degrees C for KPP, GISS, and MY, respectively,
	during 1996 - 2001.},

  title = {Altimeter derived Loop Current metrics},
  journal = {Geophysical monograph},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {161},
  pages = {181--201},
  abstract = {Altimeter-derived Loop Current metrics are used to describe Loop Current
	intrusion and eddy separation in the Gulf of Mexico for the time
	period from 1 January 1993 through I July 2004. Time series of Loop
	Current extent, boundary length, area, circulation and volume are
	determined by tracking the 17-cm contour in the daily sea surface
	height maps. This contour closely tracks the edge of the high-velocity
	core of the Loop Current. The altimetric Loop Current tracking is
	qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by direct comparisons
	with Loop Current thermal fronts observed in sea surface temperature
	imagery during times of good thermal contrast and cloud free conditions.
	Eddy separation events are identified by the changes in the Loop
	Current length associated with breaking of the tracking contour,
	with a total of 16 Loop Current eddies causing significant changes
	in the Loop Current extent during the time period. Statistical and
	spectral analyses are used to characterize the Loop Current variability
	and separation frequency. Eddy separation occurs most frequently
	at 6, 9 and 11.5 months, with little or no power at the annual frequency.
	Significant low frequency power is found near a period of 17 to 22
	months, which is associated with far southern retreat of the Loop
	Current and separation periods near 18 months. A bimodal distribution
	of the retreat after eddy separation is identified that influences
	the duration of the subsequent separation period. When the entire
	Loop Current retreats below 25N the average separation period following
	retreat is 16.2 months, much longer than the 5.5 month average for
	the cases where part of the Loop Current remains north of 25�N. More
	interesting is a nearly linear relationship between Loop Current
	retreat and subsequent separation periods. Thus the irregular retreat
	of the Loop Current after separation may explain in part why the
	Loop Current exhibits such an irregular eddy separation period.},
  owner = {mohamed},
  review = {The author presents the benefits of monitoring the Loop Current with
	Altimetry Data. He contrasts his approach to that of using AVHRR
	images that track SST. The agreement between the two data sets is
	good in cloud free conditions and in the presence of strong thermal
	contrast, moreover the front detection is not subject to SST variations
	in the GOM inflowing waters. 
	
	
	The altimetry data is mined from a variety of satellites, subjected
	to numerous environmental corrections, detided, and the SSH anomalies
	(referenced to a mean SSH from Goddard Spaceflight Center) were filtered;
	the results were objectively mapped to a 1/4 deg grid. The results
	obtained were verified against surface velocity from buoys over the
	western GOM. The eastern GOM requires more careful consideration
	since Loop Current monitoring require accurate measurement of the
	mean and time varying SSH (the mean circulation contributes significantly
	to the total dynamic topography in the eastern GOM). An independent
	SSH mean was obtained from a data-assimilation hind-cast experiment
	and added to the SSH anomaly. The SSH mean did not influence results
	qualtitatively, like eddy separation, but did influence the Loop
	Current Metrics quantitatively, the agreement was checked against
	the AVHRR images.
	
	
	The Loop Current was defined by the 17 cm SSH anomaly as in Berger
	(1996) because it matched closely with the maximum gradient of surface
	topography which in turn reflects the edge of the high velocity core
	of eddies. It also works well to track the Loop Current itself. This
	allows the time-continuous monitoring of the loop current. Several
	Loop Current metrics were computed according to the following procedure
	
	1. Read the 1/4 deg gridded SSH field and identify the 17 cm contours
	within the Gulf
	
	2. Identify Loop Current core as as that 17 cm contour that has one
	end in the Yucatan and another in the Florida Straight
	
	3. Find the max. north latitude and west longitude of this contour
	
	4. Compute Length of Loop Current
	
	5. Compute area enclosed by Loop Current
	
	6, Compute circulation around Loop Current
	
	Other metrics such as Loop Current were found not to be too useful
	
	The difficulties with the present algorithm occur when there are multiple
	17 cm contours (such when an eddy detaches)
	
	and identifying the grid cells within the Loop Current.
	
	
	The Loop Current circulation, area and length were the most highly
	correlated, and proved to be the most useful for defining eddy separation
	events, and the author use the eddy detachment is defined as the
	day. The author tracks 16 events from 1993-2004 and present their
	time series and statistics. The percentage occurence histogram look
	roughly like skewed Gaussian, although the author deems them non-gaussian.
	The authors compare the statistics of the new objective analysis
	to that of the previously used technique which he dubs as subjective.
	The average mean difference of separation time between the 2 techniques
	is 3 days and the standard deviation is 29 days within the uncertainty
	of the subjective technique. His main thrust of analyzing Loop Current
	behavior with SSH is proven.
	
	
	The author conducts a time-spectral analysis of the objective LC metrics,
	most notably the time-lapse between two separation events. Peaks
	are found at the 6, 9, and 11 months, and there is a little peak
	at 18 months in the histogram spectra. Spectra of the continuous
	time-series were analyzed too (fig 4), and peaks were found at 6,
	9 and 11.5 months, there is however an unexplained peak at 22 months.
	The author argues that 22-46 years time series is required to resolve
	the peaks at 11-11.5 months. The analysis of two separate time-series
	shows the mean and standard deviation of some metrics are stationary
	while others are not, most notatbly the separation periods. Finally,
	there seems to be a relationship between the Loop Current retreat
	latitude and time-elapsed until the next separation, this relationship
	is linear when the retreat latitude is greater then 26 N. When the
	retreat latitude is south of 25 N, the separation period is long
	(16 months on average instead of 5.5). The linear relationship can
	be extended to all events after some questionable combination of
	separation events. The author argues that there are some leeways
	in defining the retreat latitude (as the minimum max-latitude of
	the LC within a 5 day window from an eddy shedding event).},

	Model and data comparisons are made for the mean state, annual cycle,

	the PP and KPP schemes produce reasonably realistic tropical thermal
	and current structures; however, KPP is better than PP in several
	important aspects. For example, the KPP scheme simulates a more realistic
	thermocline and significantly reduces the cold surface temperature
	bias in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The depth of the maximum
	Equatorial Undercurrent simulated by the KPP scheme is much closer
	to the observation. In the extratropics the KPP scheme is significantly
	better than the PP scheme in simulating the thermal and current structures,

  abstract = {The inrushing/retraction behavior of the Loop Current (LC) in the
	eastern Gulf of Mexico can be represented by a recurrent cycle of
	vorticity input/output with a time scale of 0 to 16 months. This
	cycle is brought about as a balance between the accumulation of absolute
	vorticity in the LC and deep advection of vorticity to the Caribbean
	Sea. The vorticity time scale is directly proportional to the change
	in circulation around the LC and 2�H/Q0(f0 + ?0); where H (?800 m)
	is the thickness of the LC, Q0 is the amplitude of the deep outflow,
	and (f0 + ?0) is the absolute vorticity at Yucatan. It is proposed
	that the vorticity time scale is related to the eddy-shedding period,
	and this relation suggests that the LC adjusts itself in such a way
	as to keep 2�H/Q0(f0 + ?) constant. This parameter captures all relevant
	processes: thickness of the current, inflow through ?0 = �VI�x; the
	deep outflow; and the planetary vorticity (f0).},

	Channel is examined for a period of 22 months, from September 1999
	to June 2001, using subsurface currents from ADCP measurements at
	eight moorings across the channel, pressure measurements from coastal
	pressure sensors on both sides of the channel, QuickSCAT winds and
	AVISO altimetry data. The averaged balance between Isla Mujeres,
	M�xico, and Cabo San Antonio, Cuba, (across-channel axis) is basically
	geostrophic, but with contributions from ageostrophic terms, particularly
	friction against lower layers and to a lesser degree, the surface
	Ekman drift. Both the advective and the local acceleration terms
	appear unimportant in the side-to-side averaged balance. Interestingly,
	the averaged balance in along-channel axis is also mainly geostrophic;
	linear friction, Ekman drift, local acceleration and advective terms
	remain unimportant. An analysis of the balance from mooring to mooring
	across the channel indicates that in the region where the Yucat�n
	current meanders, the advective terms with across-channel derivatives
	contribute significantly. The EOF modes of sea level anomalies from
	altimetry and the along-channel flow in the upper 90 m surface layer
	are correlated. Their two first modes are seemingly related to the
	transport fluctuations through the channel, but also to the along-channel
	pressure gradient and to the meandering of the Yucat�n Current core,
	suggesting the presence of appreciable eddy-current interactions
	in the Channel.},

	a hierarchical Gaussian process prior. Computational challenges in
	this construction arise from the need for repeated evaluations of
	the forward model (e.g., in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo)
	and are compounded by high dimensionality of the posterior. We address
	these challenges by introducing truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansions,
	based on the prior distribution, to efficiently parameterize the
	unknown field and to specify a stochastic forward problem whose solution
	captures that of the deterministic forward model over the support
	of the prior. We seek a solution of this problem using Galerkin projection
	on a polynomial chaos basis, and use the solution to construct a
	reduced-dimensionality surrogate posterior density that is inexpensive
	to evaluate. We demonstrate the formulation on a transient diffusion
	equation with prescribed source terms, inferring the spatially-varying
	diffusivity of the medium from limited and noisy data. (C) 2008 Elsevier

	obscure spray-mediated momentum and scalar fluxes, especially for

	this paper, a new generation function for spume drops is derived,

	wind forcing. Fairly good agreement is found between this spume generation
	function and the limited data available. A potential explanation
	for the vast size differences among previous spume generation studies
	is also provided by distinguishing the drops formed at the surface

	starts with a relatively complex expression in some way anticipating

	general unknown. However, an even more important problem is the presence
	of a �slow mode�, i.e., a quasi-stationary geostrophic flow, at the
	open boundary. This geostrophic flow should be separated from the
	superimposed waves when constructing the OBC. It is also important
	to write the OBC on integrated form, to avoid model drift and make
	sure that the correct solution is approached asymptotically. New
	conditions are derived using these ideas. Several OBCs are tested
	in one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical simulations. The
	new conditions are found to perform better than the previous ones.},

  abstract = {The transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean is described
	in terms of the variation of wind speed with height and a drag coefficient
	that increases with sea surface roughness and wind speed. But direct
	measurements have only been available for weak winds; momentum transfer
	under extreme wind conditions has therefore been extrapolated from
	these field measurements. Global Positioning System sondes have been
	used since 1997 to measure the profiles of the strong winds in the
	marine boundary layer associated with tropical cyclones. Here we
	present an analysis of these data, which show a logarithmic increase
	in mean wind speed with height in the lowest 200 m, maximum wind
	speed at 500 m and a gradual weakening up to a height of 3 km. By
	determining surface stress, roughness length and neutral stability
	drag coefficient, we find that surface momentum flux levels off as
	the wind speeds increase above hurricane force. This behaviour is
	contrary to surface flux parameterizations that are currently used
	in a variety of modelling applications, including hurricane risk
	assessment and prediction of storm motion, intensity, waves and storm
	surges.},

	we have implemented a multi-component application which consists
	of many individual tasks that utilize a distributed set of computational
	and data management resources. The application consists of two 3D
	ocean circulation models of the Gulf and South Florida and a 3D oil
	spill model. The ocean models used here resolve the Gulf at 2 km
	and the South Florida region at 900 m. This high resolution information
	on the ocean state is then integrated with the oil model to track
	the fate of approximately 10 million oil particles. These individual
	components execute as MPI based parallel applications on a 576 core
	IBM Power 5 cluster and a 5040 core Linux cluster, both operated
	by the Center for Computational Science, University of Miami. The
	data and workflow between is handled by means of a custom distributed
	software framework built around the Open Project for Networked Data
	Access Protocol (OPeNDAP). In this paper, we present this application
	as an example of Many Task Computing, report on the execution characteristics
	of this application, and discuss the challenges presented by the
	many task distributed workflow involving heterogeneous components.
	The application is a typical example from the ocean modeling and
	forecasting field and imposes soft timeliness and output quality
	constraints on top of the traditional performance requirements.},

	the Florida Straits, as observed by the cable data, are observed
	prior to each ring separation. This finding is consistent over all
	separation events observed in the satellite altimetry record. The
	pulses of transport occur approximately two to four weeks before
	the rings separate. The increase in transport is usually accompanied
	by a corresponding increase in offshore sea level, suggesting forcing
	from the open ocean. The delay times between the pulses of increased
	transport and ring separations can be shown to be significantly correlated
	with the length of the Loop Current. Mean sea levels over the Caribbean
	and Gulf also peak before the separations, on average.},

  review = {The authors analyze a long time series of Florida current transport
	as recorded by cable data (and supplemented with sea level height
	measurements in the Bahamas) and relate it to loop current separation
	events. Loop current activity was monitored by altimetry data as
	prepared by Leben (multiple satellite measurements, extensive correction
	to environmental effects, various time filters are applied and most
	importantly an independently computed geoid is adopted). The bottom
	line is that the edge of the loop current is defined by the 17 cm
	SSH anomaly. This allows the authors to define a length for the loop
	current and an area, Loop Current separation is then detected by
	a sudden drop in Loop Current area. Florida Current transport is
	monitored by cable data mostly; when cable data is not available,
	sea level difference between Settlemet Point (northwest of Bahamas)
	and Key west is taken as a proxy. The authors notice a sudden increase
	in the Florida Current transport that occurs on average two weeks
	BEFORE a Loop Current Eddy pinch-off (occasionally two upticks two-weeks
	apart occur before eddy pinch-off). The authors hypothesize that
	increased transport is triggered by incoming waves from the east
	hitting the Bahamas which in turn leads to increased transport in
	the Florida Current by geostrophy; they are confident that the sea
	level rise at Settlement Point leads the transport. Finally the authors
	note that the mean sea level in the Gulf is higher then in the open
	Atlantic (about 5 cm between the Keys and Cape Hatteras) and may
	have 3 consequences: increase transport out of Florida Strait, decreased
	incoming transport from the Caribbean and possibly increased deep
	transport back into Carribean. The change in transport must propagate
	upstream the Loop Current to trigger the separation, and so the authors
	relate the time delay to the length of the Loop Current which they
	find that a speed of 2.8 m/s is required for the signal to reach
	the eddy separation point, a speed they find consistent with Loop
	Current Speed (one sentence throws me off whereby the trigger is
	now coming from the Yucatan to the separation point). Maybe the authors
	view the Florida Current Transport increase only as a tell-tale precursor
	signal but not the one ultimately responsible for the eddy separation).},

	is that this net flux is pumped downward by the convergent wind-driven
	Ekman pumping, as is typical of all midlatitude anticlyclonic gyres.
	The downward flux can follow isopycnals to depths O(500�600 m) and
	deeper by eddy mixing; a mechanism for forcing deep water to the
	south through the Yucatan Channel is provided by the intrusion and
	ring-shedding cycle of the Loop Current. Potential vorticity maps
	show that a deep flow from the western gulf back to the Yucatan Channel
	is likely.},

	general circulation model coupled to the hybrid-isopycnic ocean model
	HYCOM are described. Greenhouse gas concentrations are held fixed
	in these experiments to investigate the coupled model's ability to
	reproduce the major features of today's climate with minimal drift.
	Emphasis is placed on the realism of the oceanic general circulation
	and its effect on air-sea exchange processes. Several model runs
	using different closures for turbulent vertical exchange as well
	as improvements to reduce vertical numerical diffusion are compared
	with climate observations. As in previous studies, the Southern Ocean
	emerges as the Achilles Heel of the ocean model; deficiencies in
	its physical representation had far-reaching consequences in early
	experiments with the coupled model and have provided the strongest
	impetus for model improvement. The overarching goal of this work
	is to add diversity to the pool of ocean models available for climate
	prediction and thereby reduce biases that may stand in the way of

  abstract={We introduce a three-parameter characterization of the wind-speed dependence of the drag coefficient and apply a
Bayesian formalism to infer values for these parameters from AXBT temperature data obtained during Typhoon Fanapi. One parameter
is a multiplicative factor that amplifies or attenuates the drag coefficient for all wind speeds, the second is the maximum wind
speed at which drag coefficient saturation occurs, and the third is the drag coefficient’s rate of change with increasing wind
speed after saturation. Bayesian inference provides optimal estimates of the parameters as well as a non-Gaussian probability
distribution characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates. The efficiency of our approach stems from the use of adaptive
polynomial expansions to build an inexpensive surrogate for the high-resolution numerical model that couples simulated winds to
the oceanic temperature data, dramatically reducing the computational burden of the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling. Our
results indicate that the most likely values for the drag coefficient saturation and the corresponding wind speed are about
$2.3\times10^{−3}$ and 34 m s$^−1$, respectively; the data was not informative regarding the drag coefficient behavior at higher wind
speeds.},

  journal = {Monthly Weather Review},
  year = {2013},
  abstract={An adjoint-free approach to approximating
the gradient of a function computed using a complex numerical model
is presented. The methodology relies on polynomial chaos expansions
to approximate the model, and on differentiating the resulting
representation.  The main computational burden is an ensemble of
realizations to build the expansion; no code modification is needed. The
methodology is presented in the context of a variational parameter
estimation problem where gradients are used to iteratively minimize
the mismatch between observations and model predictions. The approach
also delivers the function's Hessian at very little extra cost, and
leverages it to enhance the performance of the iterative optimization
algorithm. Furthermore, the Hessian's inverse yields an estimate of the uncertainty
in the solution when the latter's probability density is approximately
Gaussian.  The ensuing optimal parameters are compared to those obtained
from a Bayesian inference approach where the full posterior distribution
was constructed. The similarities and differences between the new
methodology and a traditional adjoint-based calculation are discussed.},

  abstract = {The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) has been configured for
	the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) at 1/25 degrees horizontal grid resolution
	and has been nested inside a basin-scale 1/12 degrees Atlantic version
	of HYCOM. The 1/25 degrees nested GOM model is used to study temperature
	variations, current patterns, transport variations, and two coastal-trapped
	waves (CTWs) generated by Hurricane Ivan during mid September 2004.
	The model results indicate that the winds generated by Ivan: (1)
	induced a transport variation of approximately 2 Sv/day along the
	Yucatan Channel, (2) enhanced the oceanic mixing lowering the sea
	surface temperature more than 3 degrees C along Ivan's path, (3)
	produced a thermocline vertical velocity of >100 m/day, and (4) generated
	a westward transport of similar to 8 Sv along the northern coast
	of the GOM that was redirected by the Louisiana coastline inducing
	a southward transport of similar to 6 Sv. Throughout its passage
	over the Caribbean Sea Ivan generated first a CTW along the south
	east coast of Cuba. After its generation this wave propagated along
	the coast and partially propagated along the western tip of the Cuban
	Island and continued its propagation along the northern coast of
	the Island. The model existence of CTWs along the coast of Cuba is
	reported for the first time. Later on, over the Florida-Alabama-Mississippi-Louisiana
	coast, Ivan's westward winds drove a model oceanic onshore transport
	and generated a strong coastal convergence. The convergence raised
	the sea surface height similar to 90 cm generating a second CTW,
	which is characterized by alongshore and cross-shore scales of similar
	to 700 and similar to 80 km, respectively. The CTW current pattern
	includes westward surface currents of more than 2.0 m/s. After its
	generation, the wave weakened rapidly due to Ivan's eastward winds,
	however a fraction of the CTW propagated to the west and was measured
	by a tide gauge at Galveston, Texas. The descriptions, hypothesis,
	and discussions presented in this study are based on model results
	and those results are compared and validated with sea surface height
	coastal tide gauge observations and sea surface temperature buoy
	observations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of transoceanic tsunami propagation together with the detailed modeling of inundation of small-scale coastal regions poses a number of algorithmic challenges. The depth-averaged shallow water equations can be used to reduce this to a time-dependent problem in two space dimensions, but even so it is crucial to use adaptive mesh refinement in order to efficiently handle the vast differences in spatial scales. This must be done in a ``well- balanced'' manner that accurately captures very small perturbations to the steady state of the ocean at rest. Inundation can be modeled by allowing cells to dynamically change from dry to wet, but this must also be done carefully near refinement boundaries. We discuss these issues in the context of Riemann-solver based finite volume methods for tsunami modeling. Several examples are presented using the GeoClaw software and sample codes are available to accompany the paper. The techniques discussed also apply to a variety of other geophysical flows.},

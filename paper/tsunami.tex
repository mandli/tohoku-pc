\section{Approach}



% Our study focuses on quantifying the surface displacement uncertainties associated with the Manning's-N friction coefficient.  The analysis was applied to the \tohoku tsunami

% \tohoku

% \subsection{\tohoku Tsunami}

\subsection{Numerical Model}

Based on work by \cite{MacInnes:2013cr}, \cite{Berger:2011du}, \cite{Berger:2011vi}

\subsection{Observations}









\subsection{Parametric Uncertainty}
Uniform distribution is assumed as the prior for the three manning coefficients.
such that UN = [0.005-0.2]. The three regions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}(right)

\subsection{Observations}
During this tsunami, different gauges were installed to observed the surface elevation
The locations of theses gauges are shown in Figure~\ref{setup} .
The gauges are used in the inverse problem to infer the manning coefficients.

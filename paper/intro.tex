\section{Introduction} 

In this work, we aim to perform an uncertainty quantification
using Polynomial Chaos Expansion. Quantity of interest is the surface elevation.
The uncertainty in the manning coefficient is investigated.
We assume that the Manning coefficient vary by region. Specifically,
we set three values for the manning coefficient namely, at the land (denoted by N1)
and at the shore (denoted by N2) and below the water (denoted by N3).

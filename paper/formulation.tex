\section{Formulation}
\label{sec:formu}
In this section, we first, present the Bayesian approach to inverse problems 
and its application to our problem of inferring the Manning's $n$ coefficients.
We also introduce
a stochastic Polynomial Chaos-based spectral method for forward uncertainty propagation and accelerating the Bayesian inference.

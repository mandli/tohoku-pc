\section{Formulation}
\label{sec:formu}
We begin by introducing the methods employed in this work.
The Bayesian approach to inverse problems is described in Section~\ref{sec:inference};
and its application to our problem of inferring the Manning Friction Coefficients is described in Section~\ref{sec:manning}. Finally in Section~\ref{sec:uqpce}, we introduce
a stochastic spectral method for forward uncertainty propagation and accelerating the Bayesian inference.
%The two pieces are brought together in~\ref{sec:setup}.
